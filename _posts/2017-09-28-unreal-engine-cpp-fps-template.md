As I have been preparing some Unreal Engine C++ tutorials, I wanted to use the Built-in C++ FPS Template that ships with the engine as a base project and found it has VR and Touch-input code in the character class which don't serve any purpose unless you are interested in VR and/or mobile. Since I needed a super simple C++ template to not scare people away from learning this language, I decided to create a simplified version with only the essentials for non-VR projects (That's what you have the [VR Template](https://www.tomlooman.com/vrtemplate/) for these days) and make it available to all on [GitHub](https://github.com/tomlooman/SimpleFPSTemplate).

To give you an idea of the changes I made, the Character class is about 1/3 the size in code compared to the built-in FPS Template with the same functionality and several unnecessary coding concepts stripped out (such as a few UPROPERTY meta keywords you don't need to know as a newbie). The purpose of all this is to make it less intimidating to start using C++ with Unreal Engine.
