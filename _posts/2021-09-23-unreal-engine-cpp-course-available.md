> Master Unreal Engine C++ Game Development with this university-grade course.

![](images/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample5-900x446.jpg)

My **Unreal Engine C++ course** has just launched! It is packed with high-quality C++ and gameplay-focused lectures totaling nearly **30 hours of videos** and **7 assignments.**

By enrolling in your course you will be able to build a game complete with third-person action/RPG character, abilities, buffs, pickups, AI bots, multiplayer support, custom gameplay framework, user interface, menus, world interaction, save game, async loading, etc! It has an incredible amount of content that forms a solid foundation of C++ and game development principles regardless of what game you will end up creating after completing the course.

With nearly 30 hours of content it's too much to list here, I recommend checking out the course page and curriculum for a list of individual lectures _(Free Previews available too!)_

I’m incredibly excited to finally be launching this course! It’s taken a long time for everything to be polished up and ready to go. I’m absolutely certain you will love what I’ve created and truly believe it is the best thing I’ve created so far and filled to the brim with essential skills, tricks, and how-tos.

**Here is some of the content you can expect:**

- Deep dive into C++ required to build games in Unreal Engine
- Coding the “Unreal-way” to be confident you aren’t learning bad habits for your future game dev career.
- Building flexible C++ Game Framework (World Interaction, Abilities, Buffs/Debuffs, Attributes)
- Combining C++ and Blueprint for flexible game logic
- Unreal’s Gameplay Systems
- Event-based Programming Principles
- AI Programming (Behavior Trees, Blackboard, EQS, Custom C++ Nodes)
- Multiplayer Networking (Replication architecture, low-bandwidth, best practices)
- Saving Game State to Disk (Saving/loading player progression and world state)
- Performance Profiling Tools (Unreal Insights & in-editor tools)
- User Interfaces with UMG (using Event-based Principles)
- Async Asset Loading & Soft References

While this course is more challenging than my previous work and targets an intermediate level of student, you don't have to be a pro at all! Beginners to Unreal Engine or C++ are very welcome! Just make sure you bring some prior programming experience in languages similar to C++ such as C#, Java, etc. Check out the course page for more details on student requirements to see if you're a good fit!

**As some of you may know, this syllabus was taught at _Stanford University_ last year as class _CS193U_ and I’ve worked hard since then to it compatible for online self-paced learning.** _(the online course is independent of Stanford and is not affiliated with the University)_
